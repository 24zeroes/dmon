dMon is a solution for managing and monitoring daemons and apps running on your ubuntu hosts.

# From author
This app is my first try to use Golang in backend development!

# Tech details
On server side I'm using:
- [Golang](https://golang.org)
- [Gin](github.com/gin-gonic/gin) as web server
- [Viper](github.com/spf13/viper) as configuration solution 

On client side I'm planning to use:
- React as ui render library
- MobX as state management solution
